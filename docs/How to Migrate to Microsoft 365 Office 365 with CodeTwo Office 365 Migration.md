In this article, we will show you how to use CodeTwo Office 365 Migration to perform a successful migration to Microsoft 365 (Office 365) in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download and install CodeTwo Office 365 Migration
 
You can download a free trial version of CodeTwo Office 365 Migration from the official website[^1^]. The trial version allows you to migrate up to 10 items per folder for each mailbox. To remove this limitation, you need to purchase a license and activate the program.
 
After downloading the installation file, run it and follow the wizard to install the program on your computer. You will need administrator rights to do so.
 
## Step 2: Connect to your source and target servers
 
Once you launch the program, you will see the Dashboard tab, where you can manage your source and target server connections. To connect to your source server, click the Add button in the Source server section and choose your server type: Exchange Server or IMAP Server. Then, enter the required credentials and settings for your source server and test the connection.
 
To connect to your target server, click the Add button in the Target server section and choose Microsoft 365 (Office 365). Then, enter the credentials of your global administrator account and test the connection. You can also use an application account instead of an administrator account if you prefer.
 
## Step 3: Create a migration job
 
A migration job is a task that defines what data you want to migrate and how. To create a new migration job, go to the Jobs tab and click the New button. You will see a wizard that will guide you through the configuration process.
 
First, you need to select your source and target servers from the drop-down lists. Then, you need to select the mailboxes that you want to migrate from the source server and match them with the corresponding mailboxes on the target server. You can do this manually or automatically using various matching options.
 
Next, you need to choose what type of data you want to migrate: emails, contacts, calendars, tasks or everything. You can also apply some advanced options such as time filters, folder filters, public folders migration, etc.
 
Finally, you need to specify when you want to start the migration job: immediately or at a scheduled time. You can also enable automatic rescheduling if you want the job to run periodically until it is completed.
 
## Step 4: Monitor and manage your migration job
 
After creating a migration job, you can monitor its progress on the Jobs tab. You can see how many items have been migrated for each mailbox, how much time has elapsed and how much time is left. You can also access important notifications regarding the migration process.
 
If you need to pause, resume or stop a migration job, you can do so by using the buttons on the toolbar. You can also edit or delete a migration job if necessary.
 
## Step 5: Generate migration reports
 
CodeTwo Office 365 Migration allows you to generate different types of migration reports that provide you with detailed information about the migration process, such as migrated items, errors, warnings, statistics, etc. You can generate reports for the entire migration process, a specific migration job or a selected mailbox.
 
To generate a report, go to the Reports tab and click the New button. Then, choose what type of report you want to create and select the scope of data that you want to include. You can also customize some report settings such as format, name, location, etc.
 
After generating a report, you can view it on your computer or send it via email.
